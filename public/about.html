<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Dieme Kalombo. I'm a young creative with a passion for using technology to help others. 
  I design websites, apps, and graphics — especially for churches and organizations that want to grow their impact online. 
  I also manage social media and digital tools like Google Ads and SEO to help churches stay visible and connected.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I'm part of a music group called KB Production, where we create Christian music and covers. 
  I'm also deeply involved in my local church — serving in kids ministry, worship team, and media. 
  Whether it's coding, designing, or creating content, I aim to use my gifts to glorify God and serve others with excellence.</p>
